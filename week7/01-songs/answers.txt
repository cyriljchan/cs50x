Spotify Wrapped is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs from the past year. In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio Aura” for each user, a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods as dictated by [their] top songs and artists of the year.” Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. In answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Since songs.db also contains the same metrics (energy, valence, and danceability), we can obtain the person's audio aura the same way Spotify Wrapped calculates theirs.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
If there were more song metrics or points of reference, they would help determine a more accurate the "aura" of the songs. Another perhaps would be to provide more "auras" to provide a more diverse pool of results.
