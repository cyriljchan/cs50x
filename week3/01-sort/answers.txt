sort1 uses: Bubble Sort
How do you know?: Its best time complexity is O(n) and O(n^2) being the worst. It was shown when the sorted txt had an exponentially faster sorting time than the unsorted.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort
How do you know?: It has the fastest time in sorting as well as having the same best and worst time complexity.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort
How do you know?: The best and worst time complexity are both at O(n^2), which was shown in the tests.
